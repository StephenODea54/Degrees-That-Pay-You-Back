# Degrees-That-Pay-You-Back
Data visualization project based on Degrees That Pay You Back dataset from Kaggle. The files in this project were used as part of a data visualization project for the Data Analytics certificate program at Youngstown State University. All files besides the final report are included.

For future work, I would definitely like to create a shiny app that allows the user to switch between what metric to use on the choropleth. Another possibility is to add the state that each school resides in, so that the user will have more customization options on the app. Some of the plots are larger and may not format to your screen well.
